Notes on weapons
=====================


Beam visualization
-------------

* (Laser) parameters: accuracy/dissipation, power. 
* Battery parameters: number, modifiers (heavy/pd)

* Spectral mapping
    * power = spectral hue (H ∈ [0°, 240°])
    * accuracy = brighness or saturation (or combination)?
    * or alphachannel? 
        * cons: with black bg equal to bright/saturation
        * pros: can stack several beams together
    * battery total = beam width with sqrt scaling
        * might look cool with alpha stacking. Might not.


* r² drain? (a gradient?)
