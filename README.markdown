Star Admiral is either my personal testing laboratory for new django tricks
or a very Sirius attempt of making a web-based 4X space game for the web.
I don't know yet.

It if turns out to be the latter and you're interested in helping me, please
do contact me.

# Goals
Good visualization is super-important. This should be a game of huge
empires battling it out with colossal fleets out in the emptiness of space;
not a table-speedreading competition between bored actuarians.

Also it should be fun.

# TODO now
* Game setup
* Faction setup


# TODO later
* Universe generation
* Giving orders
* star map

# TODO by someone else
* Some nifty gfx design
* Marvellous UI features

# Ideas for the Future
* Computer generated images for weapons etc. Dimensions to consider:
    * power
    * technological sophistication
    * size (and with previous, level of miniaturization)
* Replace tech tree with something more interesting
* Multi-turn planetary combats
* AI for fleet combat
